## Purpose

This is just some random code I want to write. Most modules in here will be
algorithmic in nature.

## Usage

Modules will be packaged into `s/lib/<module>` after building. This is built using the same process as [fbjs](github.com/facebook/fbjs) which provides a module map to simplify imports. Feel free to try to use that.

## Building

Build using `gulp`. This assumes you've installed gulp globally with `npm install -g gulp`

## Things

Here's a list of things I want to write

1. ~~DisjointSet~~
2. AVLTree
3. ~~floydWarshall~~
4. maxFlow
5. kargers
6. minCostMaxFlow
7. kruskals
